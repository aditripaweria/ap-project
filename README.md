LOST IN SPACE
This game is inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.It emulate the core mechanics of Stick Hero while I added my own creative twist. 
This document provides the necessary details of my game.

CONCEPT
India’s mission to Jupiter,led by you, faced a sudden communication blackout as the spacecraft entered the gas giant’s orbit. 
The ISRO team determined but uncertain struggles to re- establish contact with the lost mission chief. 
In the vast silence of space you battled technical challenges, leaving the fate of the mission hanging in the cosmic balance.

ESCAPE before meteor hits the ground.

Introduction
Stickman Game is a JavaFX-based game that offers an engaging and challenging experience. Players control a stickman character and must use sticks to bridge the gaps between pillars. The game features gems that players can collect to increase their score.
Features
Dynamic Gameplay: Traverse across moving pillars and use sticks strategically to progress.
Gem Collection: Collect gems to increase your score and challenge yourself.
Multiple Characters: Choose from different stickman characters with unique appearances.

Design Patterns and OOPs Concepts
The Stickman Game incorporates the following design patterns and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
Singleton Pattern: Utilized for managing the game screen and ensuring that only one instance of the game is active.
Factory Method Pattern: Used for creating instances of different stickman characters, allowing for easy extension of character types.


Observer Pattern: Implemented for tracking and updating the gem count and score as the player collects gems during gameplay.


Strategy Pattern: Applied to the movement and control mechanisms, allowing flexibility in character behavior and interactions.


Inheritance (OOP): Extensive use of inheritance for creating a hierarchy of game elements, such as characters and pillars.


Polymorphism (OOP): Leveraged to handle different types of game elements uniformly, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.


Interfaces and Abstract Classes (OOP): Used to define common behavior and contracts for various game elements, promoting code reusability.

How to Play
- Start the game by clicking the "START" button on the main menu.
- Use the "W" key to extend the stick and create a bridge between pillars.
- Use the "RIGHT ARROW" key to move the stickman character to the right.
- Avoid falling into the gaps between pillars.
- Collect gems to increase your score.
- Enjoy the game and challenge yourself to achieve a high score!
